# epic
Fetches images from NASA EPIC and sets as wallpaper


Requirements: curl jq wget imagemagick coreutils gsettings-desktop-schemas feh


Change the permissions so that epic.sh can be run as a program, then run ./epic.sh 1280x720, or whatever resolution you would like the image in. Set up a chronjub if you want it to update every 10 minutes or whatver, and boom live satellite wallpaper.

I love himawaripy 5 years ago, and I couldn't find a working modern counterpart. So here we are.
